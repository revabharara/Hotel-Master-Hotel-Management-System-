* *Functionalities of the project:*
 
This hotel management system, created using the powerful programming language Python, is designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing a hotel. Utilizing the power of MySQL for data storage, this system provides a secure and efficient way to keep track of customer and employee information, as well as booking and room details.

Built with interactive GUI support using the tkinter library, this system is easy to navigate and use, providing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both employees and customers. The system also includes a login and register page that connects to a database and keeps logs, ensuring that all user information is secure and protected by using password encrytion techniques such as hashing.

The system provides a wide range of functionalities, including check in and check out, the ability to check room status, add and delete rooms, update room details, and manage employee information. Additionally, the system provides employee login logs, booking details, and customer information, all of which can be easily accessed and managed.

To help you better understand your hotel's occupancy, the system also includes matplotlib graphs that provide a visual representation of occupancy rates and other important data. With this system, you'll have all the tools you need to effectively manage your hotel and keep your guests happy.

* *Instructions on how to set up the project on your device.*

Follow the given series of steps to set up and run the project on your computer.

1. Download all the files from this repository and make sure they are in the same folder. Keep the images in the same folder, if not you will have to change the path of the images in the code.

2. Once downloaded, open the code and download all the required python libraries using "pip install" and set up the connection with the database.

* To set up the connection with the database make sure you have MySql downloaded and set up in your computer otherwise the project will not work.
* Then import the hotel_management database.sql database from the repository into your DBMS and set up the connection.
* In the last lines of the code under the main section make sure you configure the localhost, user, passwd and database variables in the connection variable according to your pc.

3. Some sample values have been inserted in the database for test purposes, you can continue with them or delete them as per your needs

4. If there are some other adjustments needed specific to your pc make sure you go through the code once, I have commented all of it to give you insights on how things work. With this you are all set up.

* *Details about the development and attached screenshots and demo video.*

The project makes use of the python, OOPs, MySql, matplotlib, Tkinter and other functional python libraraies.
I have made sure that the error handling in the GUI is done appropriately so that even a layman user knows where he stands incase any exception has occured.
The entire program is divided into classes and subsequent methods of those classes to ensure that the code is well distributed and easy to modify in a clean manner.
I have added all the necessary comments for anyone interested in how the code actually works and separated the various sections of the code.
The classes have been added such that a main window object is created first when the program in run and subsquently the other frame objects are created and placed into a container frame of the main window.

Below are the some screenshots of what the project looks like when run:
